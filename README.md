Civ_V_Map_Plotter
-----------------

This application is inteded to process the map produced at the end of each game
into a more aesthetically-pleasing rendition.

It does this by overlaying a hexagonal grid atop the PNG file read in, and then
sampling/averaging the color of subhexagonal regions in each hex.

See the example directory for before/after images from screen captures.

Note that the test case directory does not include results to avoid the
inclusion of copious, unnecessary, binary files.
